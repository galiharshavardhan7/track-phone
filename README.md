** About this project**
This project was created for educational purposes only.

**üëâ What it does:**

Takes a phone number as input
Extracts the country information based on the country calling code (e.g., +91 ‚Üí India, +880 ‚Üí Bangladesh) using the phonenumbers library
Uses the OpenCage Geocoding API to fetch the coordinates of that country/region
Displays the location on a map using Folium

**üëâ What it does not do:**
It does not track the exact live location of a person‚Äôs phone.
That is not possible with public libraries or APIs.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important note from OpenCage**

OpenCage cannot convert a phone number directly into a precise GPS location.
What actually happens is:
phonenumbers extracts the country/region from the number
OpenCage converts that country name into approximate coordinates (center of the country/region)
Example:

Input: +91... ‚Üí Output: India

OpenCage returns coordinates: 22.3511148, 78.6677428 (center of India, not where the phone really is).

So, this project is for fun, practice, and learning Python libraries ‚Äî not real tracking.
